# ImageDetectionYOLOv8s
This model I trained the model using Google Codelab environment to implement the code, use WANDB-AI API to save training log history, and run the training model on a Codelab with a GPU (T4). The dataset annotation was split into 80% training and 15% valid and 5% testing set use for train model.
